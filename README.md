# PoorFS
Release will always keep the latest version.
In previous versions you can find both ex release versions and debugging versions of the code( Basically more printfs)
The code went through an "I'm trying to be funny" phase at the beginning so variable names will be pretty weird if you go down the history. 
The rest is pretty self explainatory to be honest.
